# development-arrested

Development Arrested is a randomized script generator, allowing an end-user to create their very own 30-minute episode of Arrested Development. As of right now, the first season of AD is used in generating a new screenplay, however more seasons will shortly be added.

This project was created during Grace Hopper Academy's 4-day 'Stackathon'. Grace Hopper Academy is an immersive software development bootcamp focusing on Javascript and the SEAN stack.

Development Arrested was created with Javascript, Sequelize, Express, Angular, Node, HTML, and CSS/SCSS.
